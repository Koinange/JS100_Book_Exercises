console.log(parseInt('3.1415'));
/*
My Answer:
3. parseInt converts the sting into a number until it hits a non-numeric value.

Book Answer:
It evaluates to 3. 
parseInt converts strings that begin with a digit to their numeric equivalent. 
If it encounters a non-digit such as ., it stops converting. 
Thus, this example converts the 3 at the beginning of the string but ignores everything else.
