Initial guess:
Exception handling is a system in javascript that allows you to catch errors and handle them before the they turn into bugs that can cripple your code.

Solution:
Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. 
It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, 
and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
